### What I learned

In this project, I used some CSS properties to help with responsive font size, such as @media. Also, I learned how to use hover effect and transition, and animation

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

.card .info div:nth-child(5) {
text-align: center;
background-color: var(--second-color);
padding: 15px;
border-radius: 10px;
transition: all 0.2s;
cursor: pointer
}
.card .info div:nth-child(5):hover {
background-color: var(--hover-color);
}

### Continued development

I want to learn more about responsive websites and how to use the hover effect
